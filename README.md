# Arduino-Breathalyzer
This is my Arduino breathalyzer circuit I built in person, and programmed in C. It consisted of resistors, and MQ-3 sensor, LCD screen, RGB LED, and piezo speaker. The user blows a substance containing alcohol like hand sanitizer, and returns a value back for the alcohol level detected and measured in voltage.
