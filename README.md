# Arduino-Breathalyzer
This is project is a DIY Arduino breathalyzer that detects alcohol levels using an MQ-3 gas sensor. I programmed the project in C to deliver real-time feedback and with an LCD display, piezo speaker, and RGB LED. 
# Components
  * MQ-3 sensor
  * 16x2 LCD screen
  * Arduino Uno
  * RGB LED
  * Resistors
  * Breadboard and jumper wires

# How it works
  * The user blows a substance containing alcohol like hand sanitizer into the sensor
  * The sensor detects it and returns the voltage to a relative alcohol level
  * Feedback is provided through the other components

Note: TinkerCad doesn't have the MQ-3 sensor component
